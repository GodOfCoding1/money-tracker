## Money Tracker

- Money appeared to be magically disapperaing from my account. Made this repo to help analyze where money goes.
- Parses data in gpay transaction history and displays the data in a graph.

### How to use

- I mostly use Gpay for all my payements, so i extract the transaction activity on gpay from https://takeout.google.com/
- Create a folder named ```data```  and place the extracted data inside of the folder

### To do

- Expand to reading from bank statements and classifying the receiver name into categories to help auto analyze where money goes. (eg: swiggy -> food)
